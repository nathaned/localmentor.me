## how to use this!!!!laksjdflkjasdlfkjasldjflaskdjflaksjdflkajdsf
This stuff is outlined in more detail in the "gitting started notes" on google drive
1. make sure you have these things installed (just type these words into terminal and see if it knows what's up)
    * `node`
    * `npm`
    * `yarn`
    * `git`
2. `cd` into a place you want to work, then do `git clone [THIS_REPO'S URL]` this repo's url can be grabbed from the green button at the top right.
3. `cd effective-barnacle`
4. run `yarn` (this installs all the stuff necessary (it goes in node_modules), prolly take a lil bit)
5. run `yarn dev` (this will start the development server. navigate to the given address, which is probably http://localhost:3000/)
6. change some file and watch it change in the browser (a good file to change would be `components/homepage.js` because that's the homepage


this is just a playground area for you to practice git things like cloning to your machine, making a branch, committing your changes, and pushing back here.
